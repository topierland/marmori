            <img class="chevron" src="./assets/img/chevron-o.svg" alt="" />
            <div class="secret-content">
                <p>Branding has a keen relationship with cultural innovation due to the very nature of branding. Good brands should be honest and convey values that are rooted in day to day discourse and emerging cultural disruptions. Brands transform with the world around them as well as act as an accelerator for cultural change. When a brand doesn’t feel tangible, the case may be they are not connected to their cultural surroundings.
                    <br><br>For the consumer a company’s brand acts as an ethical mirror. It displays what the organisation stands for as well as is used to self-reflect and define the consumer’s own identity. We, at Marmori, delve deep in to the brands core to find the most relevant cultural disruptions to attach to.
                    <br><br>We see branding as a constant revolution, where the ones who manage to understand, adapt, and define cultural change, rise on top. Here cultural insights are necessary, and these are what we are after. Our diverse team seeks to find relevant cultural insights to each organisation to create brands that matter.
                    <br><br>Steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delve to the core to find the building blocks of the brand</li>
                    <li>Explore the brands cultural surroundings and look for emerging change</li>
                    <li>Connect relevant cultural insights to the brands core</li>
                    <li>Transform the brand accordingly to create honest brands that matter</li>

        <h2>About the Arts</h2>
        <p>In order to find novel ideas and new insights, new ways of working and producing knowledge are required.
           <br><br>What are the usual ways of working? Most answers refer to common office activities, such as meetings, talking, texting, and sending emails. These methods already narrow down the possibilities for something new and inventive.
            <br><br>We use art based methods to come up with new and unexpected views and ideas.</p>

        <p>As a craft beer enthusiast, I see
            cultural innovation in every pint. The
            evolution of the malt drink from
            bulk lagers to refined high-end
            specialities has been thrilling, and I’ve enjoyed every drop.</p>
