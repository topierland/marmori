            <p>Brands that matter</p>
            <img class="chevron" src="./assets/img/chevron-o.svg" alt="" />
            <div class="secret-content">
                <p>Branding has a keen relationship with cultural innovation due to the very nature of branding. Good brands should be honest and convey values that are rooted in day to day discourse and emerging cultural disruptions. Brands transform with the world around them as well as act as an accelerator for cultural change. When a brand doesn’t feel tangible, the case may be they are not connected to their cultural surroundings.
                    <br><br>For the consumer a company’s brand acts as an ethical mirror. It displays what the organisation stands for as well as is used to self-reflect and define the consumer’s own identity. We, at Marmori, delve deep in to the brands core to find the most relevant cultural disruptions to attach to.
                    <br><br>We see branding as a constant revolution, where the ones who manage to understand, adapt, and define cultural change, rise on top. Here cultural insights are necessary, and these are what we are after. Our diverse team seeks to find relevant cultural insights to each organisation to create brands that matter.
                    <br><br>Steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delve to the core to find the building blocks of the brand</li>
                    <li>Explore the brands cultural surroundings and look for emerging change</li>
                    <li>Connect relevant cultural insights to the brands core</li>
                    <li>Transform the brand accordingly to create honest brands that matter</li>

            <div class="secret-content">
                <p>Organisations have a lot of political power and influence on society while customers, employers, and employees mirror their values against organisations. By associating themselves with the organisation, consuming their products, voting certain parties or donating to a NCO, they are reflecting their views of the surrounding culture at the same time, and are taking part of something that they believe in.
                    <br><br>In order for organisations to make an impact, they can´t be bland, mute, or abstract anymore. They are active participants of the society by their products, services and values. We help organisations trace out the cultural disruptions to which they could be in constructive relation with, and build new innovative solutions for the underlying disruptions. Our team consists of humane professionals extending to fields of applied arts, futures studies, design and marketing.
                    <br><br>Do you know what values your company promotes and champions in the real world outside boardroom presentation decks? What are the current disruptions in your target audiences life? How does your company relate to these new opportunities?
                    <br><br>Here’s how we can help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Know the current orthodoxy of your playing field. Do you know what that playing field is, and what rules are being used?</li>
                    <li>Get intimate with your audience, and find out what emerging disruptions are bubbling under</li>
                    <li>Connect the dots on how the emerging disruptions link with business, and unearth your innovation potential</li>
                    <li>Win your audience over by championing the possibilities of cultural disruption </li>

                    Cultural innovation theory naturally concentrates on cultural disruptions and emergent issues in cultural scenes. It provides an opportunity to look deeper in to occurring changes on the social level and help companies to study their future from multiple perspectives.
                    <br><br>Change occurs with an increasingly rapid pace. Futures thinking and foresight enables companies to study trends, weak signals and mega trends affecting their business in the long term. Acquiring knowledge on long term changes help companies to act faster, stay resilient, and gain that competitive edge. Being conscious on possible and probable futures bring companies closer to the present moment by allowing them to make better decisions today.
                    <br><br>Future is created by everyday actions, and we can help you to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Study trends, weak signals and mega trends</li>
                        <li>Analyze key elements affecting the specific situation at hand</li>
                        <li>Create futures scenarios</li>
                        <li>Learn futures thinking as a key capability</li>

        <h2>About the Arts</h2>
        <p>In order to find novel ideas and new insights, new ways of working and producing knowledge are required.
           <br><br>What are the usual ways of working? Most answers refer to common office activities, such as meetings, talking, texting, and sending emails. These methods already narrow down the possibilities for something new and inventive.

        <h4>Topi Särkiniemi</h4>
        <p>As a craft beer enthusiast, I see
            cultural innovation in every pint. The
            evolution of the malt drink from
            bulk lagers to refined high-end
            specialities has been thrilling, and I’ve enjoyed every drop.</p>
        <div class="guy jesse"></div>
        <h4>Jesse Parviainen</h4>
        <p>How people react to different ideas and cultural expressions has always fascinated me, and how deep connections seemingly mundane details can create. For me, the cultural innovation is the study of seemingly everyday phenomena, and making something awesome out of it.</p>
        <div class="guy tero"></div>
        <h4>Tero Hytönen</h4>
        <p>Understanding cultural disruptions is essential when starting to create any new artworks. The work should be rooted, critical, and valid in relation to its own cultural context. I think this kind of thinking should be the starting point with any creation, including business, and innovation.</p>
        <div class="guy antti"></div>
        <h4>Antti Uimonen</h4>
        <p>I enjoy studying the current cultural situation and it's history. It enables us to open our minds to possible futures. In this rabidly changing world futures thinking is essential in order to hold a broad understanding of futures development. We are living in a time where all actions have consequences. Why not make them as conscious as possible?</p>
